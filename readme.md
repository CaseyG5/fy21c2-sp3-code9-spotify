# Casey's Demo Day 4 Overview

## "Problem"
Replicate the appearance AND basic primary login functionality of Spotify login modal 
dialog boxes to simulate logging in and loading our index.html from Sprint 3.  This included preparing:
  
- A small Login modal dialog with LOG IN button, leading to
- A Login form including username and password fields, and
- Logic to enforce username and password requirements
  
Begin on 6/28 and deliver by 7/9

## Solution
### Method:
We each coded and debugged this log in feature separately this time (sans collaboration).
HTML, CSS and Tailwind were used as before.  But we made use of JavaScript to provide form/button actions.

### Process: ~~scoping~~, ~~branching~~, coding, merging, and deploying
We each...

- Noted tasks on Jira
- Continued work on our branch
- Made commits and pushed updates
- Merged results with main branch
- Deployed for presentation

### Tools:
- PhpStorm IDE for production
- Tailwind CSS framework
- JavaScript
- GitHub for formal updates / version control
- Vercel for publishing the finished product

### Results:

- login.html (initial login box)
- login2.html (full login form)

Other members of my team (Code9) each did similar work independently.

Special thanks to Deletosh for the info on preventing a form's default action.
