# Code9 Demo Day 3 Overview

## "Problem"
Replicate the appearance of the following Spotify pages:
  
- Home screen
- My Playlist #2
- New/empty playlist
  
Begin on 6/14 and deliver by 6/25

## Solution
### Method:
We coded and debugged these pages individually with HTML & CSS and since there are 3 sections beside the main area, we each took on one of those.  For this project we got to try out a new tool, Tailwind CSS.

### Process: scoping, branching, merging, and deploying
Our team...

- Divided work to be completed
- Noted and assigned tasks on Jira
- Created our own branches
- Made commits and pushed our updates
- Merged everything together
- Deployed for presentation

### Tools:
- PhpStorm IDE for production
- (HTML) and the Tailwind CSS framework
- GitHub for collaboration / version control
- Vercel for publishing the final product

### Results:

Amelia Bradley completed the following pages:

- new_playlist.html
- top nav section

Casey Geist took care of:

- index.html (home screen)
- bottom control section

And Eleasah Whittaker provided:

- playlist2.html
- sidebar menu
